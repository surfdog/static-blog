title: "Management books developers should read, too"

I've grown a lot over the last year at my job. Things are never really the same for
long, and I've had a ton of different challenges to tackle -- both on the
technical side, but in a growing proportion on the side of people management
and technical leadership, too.

So I wanted to share some of the books I've loved over the last year,
which I would recommend even to developers who aren't currently managing
people or projects.

Because just maybe, they'll help you manage yourself better or help you
develop some empathy for your manager :wink:

## [The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey](https://www.amazon.com/One-Minute-Manager-Meets-Monkey/dp/0688103804)

_By Kenneth H. Blanchard_

This book is for managers who feel like they **don't have enough time** to do
all the things they need to do. In short, it's about how to delegate
responsibly and help people grow into solving their own problems instead
of constantly "giving you their monkey". Funny and light-hearted, you can
read this in a weekend. Pick this up if you find yourself taking on more
than you can handle.

## [Inspired: How To Create Tech Products Customers Love](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507)

_By Marty Cagan_

2018 was the year I really developed a respect for the field of product
management. A big part of that was myself trying to play product
manager and realizing how hard it was, and how much I needed help. Even
if you are a developer, gaining an deeper understanding and appreciation of
product management will make you a more valuable team member.

## [The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897)

_By Camille Fournier_

Whether you're a manager or not, if you are thinking about becoming one,
this is a fantastic book to read through. Some people might imagine that
managers get to make all the decisions or are part of all the interesting
meetings -- when in fact, a lot of our job is just getting people to
talk to each other and repeating the same message five times until it sticks.
Read this book if you think you might want to go into management but
aren't sure what to expect.

## [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884)

_By Andy Grove_

This is a management classic, and one I re-read this year. The short story is:
if you are a manager and the team isn't performing, **it's your fault**. Which
is tough to swallow sometimes! Written by the long-time CEO of Intel, Andy
Grove, this book covers all kinds of things from how to give good performance
reviews and feedback to what a day in the life of a CEO even looks like. It's
a classic for a reason, and you'll be inspired by the author's story of
rising through the ranks of Intel and his many years of management wisdom.

## [Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221)

_By John Doerr_

Honestly the book is a bit salesy, but the takeaways are still pretty good.
You don't need to read the entire book to get the message, but at least the
first half is worth reading if your company uses OKRs (Objectives and Key
Results) to **set goals and measure success**. Sometimes the author is laying
it on a bit thick about how OKRs can fix all your problems (spoiler alert:
humans still implement OKRs, it is imperfect) but I do like the OKR
methodology.

Those were the books on this topic I read (or re-read) in the last year. Here
are the two I'm starting my new year off with:

## [The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749)

_By Michael Bungay Stanier_

I'm reading this book right now, and somehow in the last few days I've meet
numerous people who've also read and loved this book. **It's super practical**:
seven questions you can ask to help the people you're <s>leading</s>
coaching to help them discover solutions on their own. 

## [Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kick-Ass-Without-Humanity/dp/1250103509)

_By Kim Scott_

I'm pretty sure this is the current "bible" of a lot of people working in tech
leadership. I've only just started after watching Kim's
[talk on radical candor](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=f-Tcr0T9Tyw)
which encouraged me to **have some tough conversations** for the good of people
around me and our relationships.
