There are a lot of blog posts and articles about how to excel at _taking_
technical interviews.

There are books, courses, coaches, and all kinds of creative ways to spend your
money at the chance at training your way into a top tech company.

You can learn exactly **which algorithms that you're expected to resurrect**
from that hazy memory known as "CS342: Data Structures and Algorithms". Tips
and insights on how _exactly_ to wow your interviewer with your prowess
wielding a whiteboard marker. Or, more generally, how to convert yourself
into a carbon copy of their "perfect candidate."

**But my question is: who's talking about how to _give_ technical interviews?**

And by "give technical interviews" I really mean "give _humane_ technical
interviews".

Let me explain.

## Why "humane" technical interviews?

Here's the thing.

It's not uncommon for developers at early stage companies to help with
interviewing the new members of their team. If you're the only developer
in your part of the tech stack, there's a pretty good chance you're already
the "baseline".

But how many developers receive formal interview training before they
start these interviews?

Especially at small companies, the resources may just not be there.

_Humane_ is at least the minimum we should be aiming for. Ideally, we're
aiming much higher.

For those of us on the other side of the not-so-proverbial table, there are a lot
of things we can do (but usually don't) that can make the experience
better for everyone.

Over three years after my first (distrous) technical interview, **I've probably
given close to 100 technical interviews**.  Sure, there are industry veterans
who've been at it a lot longer than me, but I still think I learned a lot that
newbie technical interviewers might find helpful.

**Disclaimer** -- I've given poor technical interviews. I'll probably give
more of them, despite my best efforts. Sometimes there are circumstances
that lead to a suboptimial interview: whether that's a poor video call connection,
having a headache that affects your focus, or just wording something poorly.
The important thing is to recognize these factors when it comes to evaluating
how the candidate did.

## Tips for giving humane technical interviews

### Know what you're looking for first

### Want the candidate to succeed

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are two kinds of technical interviews: ones where the interviewer wants you to succeed, and ones where they are desperately trying to prove that they&#39;re a pedantic know-it-all with a deeply-rooted sense of inadequacy.</p>&mdash; Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1145796300719435776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2019</a></blockquote>

### Set expectations and clarify the scope

### Understand and respect the candidate's personality type

Give ample breaks

### Affirm the candidate when they give a great answer

### Let the candidate a work in realistic conditions

**Humane technical interviews are not the same as _easy_ technical interviews.**

### Be aware of your biases

### Ask for feedback
