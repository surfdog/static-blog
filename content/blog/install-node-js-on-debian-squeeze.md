I had some issues with libraries installed via npm (such as d3 and jsdom) causing segmentation faults in Mocha tests. Ultimately I realized that it wasn't a problem with these node modules so much as it was with my node install itself. I had installed from source following [this guide](http://sekati.com/etc/install-nodejs-on-debian-squeeze), but it wasn't quit enough to get my node install right on Debian Squeeze.

## Install Node.js
### Dependencies

Pretty standard stuff -- make sure you're up to date on these.

    $ sudo apt-get update && apt-get install git-core curl build-essential openssl libssl-dev

### Clone the Git Repo

Change into the directory you want to install node from. A good option, if in doubt, is to just go for `/opt`.

    
    $ git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git
    cd node

Check the [Node.js Download Page](http://nodejs.org/download/) and see what they say the latest version of Node is that we should be using. At the time of writing, this was **v0.10.28**. Find this using `git tag`:

    $ git tag

There may be a newer version in the Git repo than the one recommended on the Download page, however it may not be stable. Check it out:

    $ git checkout v0.10.28

You should see **(Stable)** after the version number once you perform this checkout.

### Make and Install

Configure node. The section option `--without-snapshot` should give you a faster build and alleviate some seg fault issues mentioned [elsewhere](http://www.armhf.com/node-js-for-the-beaglebone-black/) around the web.

    $ ./configure --openssl-libpath=/usr/lib/ssl --without-snapshot

Now make and install (it could take some time to complete the make testing and process, as we're compiling the source code).

    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

If it worked, you'll be able to run both of these commands:
    
    $ node -v
    $ npm -v

## If you messed up...

...like me, and installed a totally wrong and unstable version, luckily there's still hope. Change into the directory where you put the node source:

    $ make uninstall

Now you can switch branches, re-configure, and re-build the node source as needed. Just be sure to check with `node -v` again after you've done the install to be sure everything worked. Good luck!
