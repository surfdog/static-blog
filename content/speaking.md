## Talks

### Building resilient frontend architecture ([Slides](/building-resilient-frontend-architecture.pdf))

Change is inevitable. So is legacy. And too often, we as developers (who love
to solve problems by coding) fall into the trap of believing the only way to
fix it is by rewriting everything again and again. But how can we design an
application architecture that is more resilient to change in the first place?
How can we defend against entropy in a system where people are pushing changes
every day? In this talk we’ll define what architecture means for the frontend,
dispel some commonly-held myths, and look at specific tools and techniques on a
scale from micro to macro that you can use today to keep your app from turning
into that infamous ball of mud.

> This talk was given at **Agent Conf** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HudXYWLBTHw)), **FrontCon** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNVS6sAwXm4)), **React Finland** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brMZLmZ1HR0)), and
> **React Not a Conf** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3HQII-l8Tk)).

### Independent deployment of the frontend with Docker and Kubernetes

Why would you even want to move to a microfrontends architecture? You'll learn
the motivation, core concepts and principles behind microservices, how they can
help your frontend team work more efficiently, and the tradeoffs that are
normally involved when you try to apply them to single-page applications.
Luckily, Docker and Kubernetes can alleviate a lot of these issues, and we’ll
walk through a minimal but concrete example of building a microfrontends
architecture with these tools on your local machine.  Finally, you’ll see how
you could migrate gradually and what it takes to bring this architecture to
production. No previous knowledge of Docker or Kubernetes is required.

> This talk was given at **JS Kongress**.

### Secrets to a successful design system ([Slides](/secrets-to-a-successful-design-system.pdf))

Inconsistent UI is the enemy of developers and designers alike. And while
design systems are a modern and scalable way to solve this challenge,
implementing one is not as straightforward as it might seem: from getting
buy-in from management to picking your tech stack, rolling it out, and
releasing changes to multiple apps &mdash; there are a lot of things that can
go wrong. In this talk, you'll learn how to pitch a design system to your boss,
rarely discussed technical caveats and challenges, and how to set your design
system up for success from the start.

> This talk was given at **React Day Berlin** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPXJ5ERg9Wo&t=8710s))

### The tech behind a design system that scales ([Slides](/tech-behind-a-design-system-that-scales-brazil-js.pdf))

Design systems are a powerful way to scale a visual language across different
products and technologies. This talk covers what a design system is and how a
React-based tech stack can power a design system that scales as the number of
developers, products, and parallel processes grows. You'll also learn about
critical considerations and best practices you'll want to apply when
introducing a design system at your company.
