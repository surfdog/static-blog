My core values are empowerment and empathy, and I thrive on helping teams
building sustainable technical solutions that take into account the human
element of software. I also love building collaborative teams, sharing my
knowledge, and mentorship.

I'm always interested in learning about new opportunities, and am also
available for consulting.

## My values & beliefs

1. **Empowerment** -- I believe the best results come from trusting people,
   equipping them with good information, and encouraging them to be creative.
2. **Empathy** -- The only way to build sustainable software is to empathize
   with your customers and your colleagues. Ask questions and be open to other
   points of view.
3. **Curiosity** -- Being open and interested to learn continuously is
   important, both for individuals and for organizations at large.
4. **Humility** -- I'm a strong believer in servant leadership. My job is not
   to be the superstar but to help other people learn, understand the "why",
   and lift them up when they succeed.

## About me

At my core, I'm a self-taught developer who started coding at 10 years old.
From there I supplemented my knowledge by studying Computer Science, and have
been working in software engineering for nearly a decade -- both as an
individual contributor and as a manager. My current challenge
is my work at [SumUp](https://sumup.com), an international FinTech company
that I've been with on its journey from 80 to more than 1,500 employees as
its Frontend Lead.
