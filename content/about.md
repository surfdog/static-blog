Hi, my name is Monica. I'm an American software engineer and engineering
manager living and working in Berlin, Germany.

I started coding when I was 10 years old, and haven't stopped since then. In my
nearly 10-year technical career, I have worked in a wide range of domains such
as cloud services, natural language processing, e-learning, and fintech. My
roles have ranged from individual contributor to technical lead and manager.

These days I'm leading a distributed team of 15+ frontend engineers at
[SumUp](https://sumup.com), a German fintech company with major offices in
Berlin, Sofia, and SÃ£o Paulo.
