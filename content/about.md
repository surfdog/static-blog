Hi, my name is Monica. I'm an American software engineer and engineering
manager living and working in Berlin, Germany.

I started coding when I was 10 years old, and haven't stopped since then. In my
nearly 10-year technical career (not including coding in my teens :wink:), I have
worked in a wide range of domains such as cloud services, natural language
processing, e-learning, and fintech.

My roles have ranged from individual contributor to technical lead and manager.

These days I'm leading a distributed team of 15+ frontend engineers at
[SumUp](https://sumup.com), a German fintech company I've worked at as it grew
from 80 to more than 1,500 people in the last 4+ years.

In my spare time, I'm building [Affilimate](https://affilimate.io), an
affiliate analytics and optimization tool, which is currently in a private
beta. I also blog about travel and photography on [Not a Nomad Blog](https://notanomadblog.com),
which reaches over 40,000 unique users per month.
