Hi, my name is Monica. I'm an American software engineer and engineering
manager living and working in Berlin, Germany.

I started coding when I was 10 years old, and haven't stopped since then. In my
nearly 10-year technical career (not including coding in my teens :wink:), I have
worked in a wide range of domains such as cloud services, natural language
processing, e-learning, and fintech.

My roles have ranged from individual contributor to technical lead and manager.

Most recently, I was leading a distributed team of 15+ frontend engineers at
[SumUp](https://sumup.com), a German fintech company I've worked at as it grew
from 80 to more than 1,500 people about 5 years.

Today, I'm building my own startup called [Affilimate](https://affilimate.io), a
tool that helps bloggers earn more from their content with actionable affiliate analytics.
It's currently in private beta, but you're welcome to email me for an invite
or about partnership opportunities.

In my spare time, I blog about travel and photography on [Not a Nomad Blog](https://notanomadblog.com),
which reaches over 60,000 unique readers per month.

Interested in working together? Learn more on my [work with me](/work-with-me) page.
